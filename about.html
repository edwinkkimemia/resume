    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <img src="./images/eddt.jpg" alt="EDWIN'S PHOTO" width="100" height="100">
    <p>My life right now feels like a vibrant tapestry, woven with threads of change and innovation. I stand at the threshold of a new dawn, having decided to trade my stethoscope for a keyboard, my white coat for the glow of a computer screen. This shift from medicine to tech isn't just a career change; it's an adventure into the unknown, my quest for knowledge and mastery in a new domain. </p>
        <p>

        I'm like a seasoned explorer, charting a course through uncharted digital territories, with each line of code I write being a step towards building my new identity. My days are filled with the excitement of learning, the challenge of explaining this new world to those who've seen me only as a healer, and the quiet moments of self-reflection on what it means to evolve.</p>
        
        Imagine this: my home, once filled with medical journals, now buzzes with the hum of tech blogs, podcasts about AI, and the silent dance of algorithms. My conversations have shifted from diagnosing ailments to dissecting data structures. Yet, the essence of who I am remains - a problem solver, a caregiver, now for the intricacies of systems rather than human bodies.</p>
        
        As I near the moment to hang up my stethoscope for a bit, I'm not just closing one chapter but eagerly flipping to the next, where my project ideas are like seeds I'm planting, hopeful for what they might grow into. This phase of my life is a tapestry of learning, adapting, and dreaming, with each thread colored by my past experiences and brightened by the promise of what's to come.</p>
